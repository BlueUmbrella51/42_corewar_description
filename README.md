# Corewar

This project was done as part of my education at Codam, part of the 42 network of coding schools.

This program was written in collaboration with Kim de Winter and Simon Cleerdin

<h3>Assignment</h3>

For this project, we were asked to recreate [Core Wars](http://corewars.org/), a programming game in which two or more programs run
on a simulated computer with the goal of terminating each other while surviving as long as possible.

The challenge was comprised of three parts:
1. We had to create an assembler, which could read the programs and translate them into a hexadecimal representation
  following certain guidelines.
2. We had to create a virtual machine, which could read and execute all possible operations that a competing program 
  could use.
3. We had to write our own program (also known as a "champion"), that could compete in the Core Wars game.

The entire assigment can be read here: [Corewar subject](https://github.com/LER1990/42_subjects/blob/master/corewar.en.pdf).
(Fair warning: it is a little cryptic!)
